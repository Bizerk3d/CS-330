**How do I approach designing software?**

I like to make sure that I always keep the big picture in mind - reviewing the rubric/user stories/project frequently ahead of time (and while continuing to design) to have a really firm grasp on what we're accomplishing.  Past that, following the concept of "just enough" for each increment is helpful; I like to get it working enough to fulfill requirements, and then I can circle back and add additional features/customization/functionality if time permits.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**

It has helped me hone in on what is important to consider in the initial design phase, as well as appreciation for allocating additional time for areas that could prove difficult - better estimation or more leeway allowed for larger components.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**

Defining the problem, researching solutions, working incrementally, creating a minimum viable product (MVP), and then improving the product was the overall design process I followed.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

This is a fairly evergreen approach to design that I can apply to practically any other project/work with some modifications, so I intend to use it frequently!

**How do I approach developing programs?**

In addtional to the tactics from above, one of the biggest factors for me is breaking the program down into its components.  The adage, "How do you eat an elephant?  A bite at a time" springs to mind.  Some projects, like the Final for this course, can be intimidating if you consider it in its entirety and it can be difficult to know where to start.  Breaking it down, prioritizing those elements, creating MVPs, and then improving as needed helps developing programs feel much more attainable.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**

Research was more useful than ever - I often would have to study a few different ways to implement an element of the scene, and then explore which of those options best fit my needs.  Naturally, as a result paying attention to version control and iteration was more important than ever too.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**

Iteration was incredibly important for this project; I set up a repository straight from Visual Studio to test that functionality for the first time.  I used this to create a second branch when exploring options for tough issues to fix so that I would not have to retrace my steps if it went wildly wrong - exceptionally helpful!

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**

I gained even more appreciation for version control as I went through the process, as I had a few early moments where I wasn't considering that and spent additional time backtracking as a result when I "broke" something.  I also gained fluency with various practices and felt far more comfortable adjusting components of the code and knowing what would happen as a result - less guesswork by the end, whereas the beginning featured a lot of exploratory practices.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

A strong background in computer science will help me be more well-rounded as a I pursue my goal of becoming a software engineer.  Additionally, many of the concepts used for classes are transferrable - even if I don't work in computer graphics, the lessons learned (such as focusing on version control, incremental approaches to code) in this class will serve me well in my career.  Finally, the challenge and reward of computer science fulfill some of the primary desires I had when starting this degree!

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**

Similarly to the last answer, the general skills are transferrable.  In addition, a few of the more specific skills and knowledge can still be useful - I anticipate further design work in future classes and anticipate these skills could prove valuable there.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

Similarly to the last few answers, the general skills are always transferrable.  In addition, a few of the more specific skills and knowledge can still be useful - matrices manipulation is useful in many domains so practice there is always appreciated.
